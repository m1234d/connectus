Want to see it in action? 
Check out the demo: https://simplewebrtc.com/demo.html

Want to run it locally?
1. Install all dependencies and run the test page
```bash
npm install && npm run test-page
```

2. open your browser to https://0.0.0.0:8443/test/

## It's so easy:

### 1. Some basic html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://simplewebrtc.com/latest-v2.js"></script>
        <style>
            #remoteVideos video {
                height: 150px;
            }
            #localVideo {
                height: 150px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <video id="localVideo"></video>
        <div id="remoteVideos"></div>
    </body>
</html>

```

### Installing through NPM
```sh
npm install --save simplewebrtc

# for yarn users
yarn add simplewebrtc
```
After that simply import simplewebrtc into your project
```js
import SimpleWebRTC from 'simplewebrtc';
```

### 2. Create our WebRTC object

```js
var webrtc = new SimpleWebRTC({
    // the id/element dom element that will hold "our" video
    localVideoEl: 'localVideo',
    // the id/element dom element that will hold remote videos
    remoteVideosEl: 'remoteVideos',
    // immediately ask for camera access
    autoRequestMedia: true
});
```

### 3. Tell it to join a room when ready

```js
// we have to wait until it's ready
webrtc.on('readyToCall', function () {
    // you can name it anything
    webrtc.joinRoom('your awesome room name');
});
```

### Available options


`peerConnectionConfig` - Set this to specify your own STUN and TURN servers. By
default, SimpleWebRTC uses Google's public STUN server
(`stun.l.google.com:19302`), which is intended for public use according to:
https://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg/status/354105684591251456

Note that you will most likely also need to run your own TURN servers. See
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/ for a basic
tutorial.

## Filetransfer
Sending files between individual participants is supported. See
http://simplewebrtc.com/filetransfer.html for a demo.

Note that this is not file sharing between a group which requires a completely
different approach.

## It's not always that simple...

Sometimes you need to do more advanced stuff. See
http://simplewebrtc.com/notsosimple.html for some examples.

## API

### Constructor

`new SimpleWebRTC(options)`

- `object options` - options object provided to constructor consisting of:
  - `string url` - *required* url for signaling server. Defaults to signaling
  server URL which can be used for development. You must use your own signaling
  server for production.
  - `object socketio` - *optional* object to be passed as options to the signaling
  server connection.
  - `Connection connection` - *optional* connection object for signaling. See
  `Connection` below. Defaults to a new SocketIoConnection
  - `bool debug` - *optional* flag to set the instance to debug mode
  - `[string|DomElement] localVideoEl` - ID or Element to contain the local video
  element
  - `[string|DomElement] remoteVideosEl` - ID or Element to contain the
  remote video elements
  - `bool autoRequestMedia` - *optional(=false)* option to automatically request
  user media. Use `true` to request automatically, or `false` to request media
  later with `startLocalVideo`
  - `bool enableDataChannels` *optional(=true)* option to enable/disable data
  channels (used for volume levels or direct messaging)
  - `bool autoRemoveVideos` - *optional(=true)* option to automatically remove
  video elements when streams are stopped.
  - `bool adjustPeerVolume` - *optional(=false)* option to reduce peer volume
  when the local participant is speaking
  - `number peerVolumeWhenSpeaking` - *optional(=.0.25)* value used in
  conjunction with `adjustPeerVolume`. Uses values between 0 and 1.
  - `object media` - media options to be passed to `getUserMedia`. Defaults to
  `{ video: true, audio: true }`. Valid configurations described
  [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)
  with official spec
  [at w3c](http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia).
  - `object receiveMedia` - *optional* RTCPeerConnection options. Defaults to
  `{ offerToReceiveAudio: 1, offerToReceiveVideo: 1 }`.
  - `object localVideo` - *optional* options for attaching the local video
  stream to the page. Defaults to
  ```javascript
  {
      autoplay: true, // automatically play the video stream on the page
      mirror: true, // flip the local video to mirror mode (for UX)
      muted: true // mute local video stream to prevent echo
  }
  ```
  - `object logger` - *optional* alternate logger for the instance; any object
  that implements `log`, `warn`, and `error` methods.
  - `object peerConnectionConfig` - *optional* options to specify own your own STUN/TURN servers. 
  By default these options are overridden when the signaling server specifies the STUN/TURN server configuration. 
  Example on how to specify the peerConnectionConfig: 
  ```javascript
  {
    "iceServers": [{
            "url": "stun3.l.google.com:19302"
        },
        {
            "url": "turn:your.turn.servers.here",
            "username": "your.turn.server.username",
            "credential": "your.turn.server.password"
        }
    ],
    iceTransports: 'relay'
  }
  ```

### Fields

`capabilities` - the
[`webrtcSupport`](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/webrtcsupport) object that
describes browser capabilities, for convenience

`config` - the configuration options extended from options passed to the
constructor

`connection` - the socket (or alternate) signaling connection

`webrtc` - the underlying WebRTC session manager

### Events

To set up event listeners, use the SimpleWebRTC instance created with the
constructor. Example:

```javascript
var webrtc = new SimpleWebRTC(options);
webrtc.on('connectionReady', function (sessionId) {
    // ...
})
```

`'connectionReady', sessionId` - emitted when the signaling connection emits the
`connect` event, with the unique id for the session.

`'createdPeer', peer` - emitted three times:

- when joining a room with existing peers, once for each peer
- when a new peer joins a joined room
- when sharing screen, once for each peer

- `peer` - the object representing the peer and underlying peer connection

`'channelMessage', peer, channelLabel, {messageType, payload}` - emitted when a broadcast message to all peers is received via dataChannel by using the method sendDirectlyToAll(). 


`'stunservers', [...args]` - emitted when the signaling connection emits the
same event

`'turnservers', [...args]` - emitted when the signaling connection emits the
same event

`'localScreenAdded', el` - emitted after triggering the start of screen sharing

- `el` the element that contains the local screen stream

`'joinedRoom', roomName` - emitted after successfully joining a room with the name roomName

`'leftRoom', roomName` - emitted after successfully leaving the current room,
ending all peers, and stopping the local screen stream

`'videoAdded', videoEl, peer` - emitted when a peer stream is added

- `videoEl` - the video element associated with the stream that was added
- `peer` - the peer associated with the stream that was added

`'videoRemoved', videoEl, peer` - emitted when a peer stream is removed

- `videoEl` - the video element associated with the stream that was removed
- `peer` - the peer associated with the stream that was removed

### Methods

`createRoom(name, callback)` - emits the `create` event on the connection with
`name` and (if provided) invokes `callback` on response

`joinRoom(name, callback)` - joins the conference in room `name`. Callback is
invoked with `callback(err, roomDescription)` where `roomDescription` is yielded
by the connection on the `join` event. See [signalmaster](https://github.com/andyet/signalmaster) for more details.

`startLocalVideo()` - starts the local media with the `media` options provided
in the config passed to the constructor

`testReadiness()` - tests that the connection is ready and that (if media is
enabled) streams have started

`mute()` - mutes the local audio stream for all peers (pauses sending audio)

`unmute()` - unmutes local audio stream for all peers (resumes sending audio)

`pauseVideo()` - pauses sending video to peers

`resumeVideo()` - resumes sending video to all peers

`pause()` - pauses sending audio and video to all peers

`resume()` - resumes sending audio and video to all peers

`sendToAll(messageType, payload)` - broadcasts a message to all peers in the
room via the signaling channel (websocket)

- `string messageType` - the key for the type of message being sent
- `object payload` - an arbitrary value or object to send to peers

`sendDirectlyToAll(channelLabel, messageType, payload)` - broadcasts a message
to all peers in the room via a dataChannel

- `string channelLabel` - the label for the dataChannel to send on
- `string messageType` - the key for the type of message being sent
- `object payload` - an arbitrary value or object to send to peers

`getPeers(sessionId, type)` - returns all peers by `sessionId` and/or `type`

`shareScreen(callback)` - initiates screen capture request to browser, then
adds the stream to the conference

`getLocalScreen()` - returns the local screen stream

`stopScreenShare()` - stops the screen share stream and removes it from the room

`stopLocalVideo()` - stops all local media streams

`setVolumeForAll(volume)` - used to set the volume level for all peers

- `volume` - the volume level, between 0 and 1

`leaveRoom()` - leaves the currently joined room and stops local screen share

`disconnect()` - calls `disconnect` on the signaling connection and deletes it

`handlePeerStreamAdded(peer)` - used internally to attach media stream to the
DOM and perform other setup

`handlePeerStreamRemoved(peer)` - used internally to remove the video container
from the DOM and emit `videoRemoved`

`getDomId(peer)` - used internally to get the DOM id associated with a peer

`getEl(idOrEl)` - helper used internally to get an element where `idOrEl` is
either an element, or an id of an element

`getLocalVideoContainer()` - used internally to get the container that will hold
the local video element

`getRemoteVideoContainer()` - used internally to get the container that holds
the remote video elements

### Connection

By default, SimpleWebRTC uses a [socket.io](http://socket.io/) connection to
communicate with the signaling server. However, you can provide an alternate
connection object to use. All that your alternate connection need provide are
four methods:

- `on(ev, fn)` - A method to invoke `fn` when event `ev` is triggered
- `emit()` - A method to send/emit arbitrary arguments on the connection
- `getSessionId()` - A method to get a unique session Id for the connection
- `disconnect()` - A method to disconnect the connection
